# Presentation
This package features a function named `SDEclassif` which is a multiclass classifier of the plug-in type for diffusion paths generated by stochastique differential equations. This classification procedure is built in a nonparametric setting where the drft and diffusion coefficients are assumed unknown. The upcoming paper which studies this nonparametric classification  procedure is avalaible [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10259).
# How to use the package
The `SDEclassif` `R`-package can be installed by running the code 
````R
devtools::install_github("Eddymichelella/SDEclassif")
````
The diffusion paths have to be displayed by columns in a matrix or data.frame.
